	// Recovering the Call Stack
	// To fix a fault, we will want to determine what code was running when the fault occurred. To accomplish this, we need to recover the register state at the time of exception entry.
	// If the fault is readily reproducible and we have a debugger attached to the board, we can manually add a breakpoint for the function which handles the exception. In GDB this will look something like
	//	(gdb) break HardFault_Handler
	// Upon exception entry some registers will always be automatically saved on the stack. Depending on whether or not an FPU is in use, either a basic or extended stack frame will be pushed by hardware.
	// Regardless, the hardware will always push the same core set of registers to the very top of the stack which was active prior to entering the exception. ARM Cortex-M devices have two stack pointers, msp & psp. Upon exception entry, the active stack pointer is encoded in bit 2 of the EXC_RETURN value pushed to the link register. If the bit is set, the psp was active prior to exception entry, else the msp was active.
	//	(gdb) p/x $lr
	//	$4 = 0xfffffffd
	//	# psp was active prior to exception if bit 2 is set
	//	# otherwise, the msp was active
	//	(gdb) p/x $lr&(1<<2)
	//	$5 = 0x4
	//	# First eight values on stack will always be:
	//	# r0, r1, r2, r3, r12, LR, pc, xPSR
	//	(gdb) p/a *(uint32_t[8] *)$psp
	//	$16 = {
	//	  0x0 <g_pfnVectors>,
	//	  0x200003c4 <ucHeap+604>,
	//	  0x10000000,
	//	  0xe0000000,
	//	  0x200001b8 <ucHeap+80>,
	//	  0x61 <illegal_instruction_execution+16>,
	//	  0xe0000000,
	//	  0x80000000
	//	}
	// Offset 6 and 7 in the array dumped hold the LR (illegal_instruction_execution) & PC (0xe0000000) so we now can see exactly where the fault originated!
	
	// Faults from Faults!
	// The astute observer might wonder what happens when a new fault occurs in the code dealing with a fault. If you have enabled configurable fault handlers (i.e MemManage, BusFault, or UsageFault), a fault generated in these handlers will trigger a HardFault.
	// Once in the HardFault Handler, the ARM Core is operating at a non-configurable priority level, -1. At this level or above, a fault will put the processor in an unrecoverable state where a reset is expected. This state is known as Lockup.
	// Typically, the processor will automatically reset upon entering lockup but this is not a requirement per the specification. For example, you may have to enable a hardware watchdog for a reset to take place. It's worth double checking the reference manual for the MCU being used for clarification.
	// When a debugger is attached, lockup often has a different behavior. For example, on the NRF52840, "Reset from CPU lockup is disabled if the device is in debug interface mode"5.
	// When a lockup happens, the processor will repeatedly fetch the same fixed instruction, 0xFFFFFFFE or the instruction which triggered the lockup, in a loop until a reset occurs.
	// Fun Fact: Whether or not some classes of MemManage or BusFaults trigger a fault from an exception is actually configurable via the MPU_CTRL.HFNMIENA & CCR.BFHFNMIGN register fields, respectively.

	// Halting & Determining Core Register State
	// What if we are trying to debug an issue that is not easy to reproduce? Even if we have a debugger attached, useful state may be overwritten before we have a chance to halt the debugger and take a look.
	// The first thing we can do is to programmatically trigger a breakpoint when the system faults:
	//	// NOTE: If you are using CMSIS, the registers can also be
	//	// accessed through CoreDebug->DHCSR & CoreDebug_DHCSR_C_DEBUGEN_Msk
	//	#define HALT_IF_DEBUGGING()                              
	//	  do {                                                   
	//		if ((*(volatile uint32_t *)0xE000EDF0) & (1 << 0)) { 
	//		  __asm("bkpt 1");                                   
	//		}

This is because writes will sometimes be buffered prior to being flushed to prevent pipeline stalls so the program counter will advance before the actual data store completes.
