                    SmartFusion2 High Performance DMA example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates High Performance DMA (HPDMA) transfers between
memory buffers located in the SmartFusion2 MSS eSRAM and external DDR memory
connected to the MDDR memory controller.

This example is an infinite loop in which one buffer located in internal eSRAM
is loaded with a test pattern which changes on each loop iteration. The content
of this first buffer is then transfered to a second buffer located in MDDR
memory. The content of the MDDR buffer is then transfered back into a third
buffer located in internal eSRAM.

The same operations are repeated infinitely with a different test pattern
allowing to see the content of the target buffer changing on each loop
iteration.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set a watch on the eSRAM buffers g_buffer_a and g_buffer_b.
Open a debugger memory window to view the content of MDDR address 0xA0000000.
Set a breakpoint on the line incrementing a dummy counter: ++dummy;
You will see the content of g_buffer_a copied to address 0xA0000000 and
g_buffer_b every time the debugger stops on the breakpoint.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project requires a SmartFusion2 design where the MDDR memory
controller is properly configured to access external DDR memory. Please note
that the content of the "drivers_config/sys_config" in this example project must
match the content of the "firmware/drivers_config/sys_config" folder in your
Libero project for the MDDR memory controller to be configured properly.

This example is built to execute on an M2S090 die. You will need to overwrite 
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with the 
one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a newer silicon 
revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
